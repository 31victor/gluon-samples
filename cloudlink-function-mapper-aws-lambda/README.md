CloudLink-Function-Mapper-AWS-Lambda
===========

Learn how you can integrate your Java Mobile application with Amazon AWS Lambda by configuring Remote Functions in Gluon CloudLink.
The Java Mobile code calls a Gluon CloudLInk remote function with parameters which will in its turn call the mapped AWS Lambda function.
